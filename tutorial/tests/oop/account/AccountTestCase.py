        # 3. Assert the accounts owners attributes
        # 4. Assert all accounts have the right balance (0 if not passed in constructor)
        # 5. Make a series of deposits and withdrawals
        # 6. Assert the new balance states
        # 7. Make a withdrawal that exceeds the available balance. Assert an exception has been raised

        # BONUS: Overload the constructor to accept another argument which will be account's allowed minus. Implement
        # the minus feature and `guard` the original constructor from passing negative values (validation of parameters)

        # BONUS 2: Add the delete feature (overwrite dunder __del__() method) to delete Persons's account
